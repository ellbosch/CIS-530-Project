STOP FOR DURATION I 've been paying MONEY DURATION for access to product reviews on the Consumer Reports Web site STOP  I 'm not an appliance junkie STOP  I just happened to sign up when my husband and I were looking for a washer-dryer and told myself It 's only MONEY DURATION I 'll cancel as soon as we figure out what to buy STOP  Although we put that purchase off I was reluctant to cancel and give up all those handy product ratings STOP  What if we needed a blender STOP  Switching to the SET subscriber rate of MONEY would have saved money but my own inertia worked against me STOP  Soon the SET fee blended into all the other charges on my credit card statement and I forgot it was there STOP  And kept paying it STOP
