STOP Like many women my experience shopping for pants is often an exercise in futility STOP  It goes something like this STOP  I enter the dressing room full of hope with a stash of pants that look really cute hip and flattering on the hanger STOP  But after DURATION NUMBER of yanking and zipping I return the whole pile of ill-fitting clothing and leave the store annoyed and empty handed STOP
