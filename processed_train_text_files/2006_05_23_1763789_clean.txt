STOP I HAVE a nose for scents STOP  It 's something I 've developed after DURATION in the fragrance industry STOP  I can sniff out a compound in a perfume that most other people could n't detect STOP  But there is a catch I ca n't turn it off STOP  My sensitive nose is in the permanent '' on '' position even when I travel STOP  We all know what it 's like to be downwind from the lady at the opera who slathered too much tuberose on herself before the performance STOP  You feel as if you 're going to pass out STOP
